Probe - a collection of useful utilities for debugging and profiling python modules.

Grenade - an object-oriented api for accessing Shotgun (created by extending the functional api shotgun already provide).

Miki - a collection of useful utilities for generating code/api documentation for python (and C++) projects, based on the open-source package Sphinx.

Napalm - a lightweight template-based library for vfx data runtime exchange and serialisation, with python bindings.

H5cpp - a low-level C++ API for HDF5, which introduces type safety and scoped asset destruction, without imposing an OO hierarchy.

dgal - an adaptor-based template library of geometric algorithms, mostly consisting of clipping routines. Includes a fast and stable voronoi fracturer which uses qhull.

hdk\_utls - various utility classes and functions for working with SOPs in Houdini 11.

clip\_sops - a library of SOPs which bind dgal to houdini. Provides plane clipping, convex hull clipping and voronoi fracturing, of an arbitrary mesh. Currently H11 only.

bimath - a small template library which adds boost serialisation and various type traits to ILM's Imath library.

graphite - A frontend to RRD graphing. Used to build custom graphs from Zenoss and Ganglia data collectors.

Sherman - Web-based disk capacity management. Show a tree of your filesystem with historical and relative size usage of all directories.

tasklogger - Simple C utility that ties into Linux kernel accounting. Keeps a log of every process run and resource utilization.

sgGate - Shotgun Gateway - pulls e-mails into Shotgun tickets.

Review Tools - GUI utility to build RV playlists, ties into Shotgun.

KIP - Tool for keyframe interchanging project for Houdini, Maya and Nuke

**Certus** is a system which resolves dependencies between objects. It contains several subsystems:

> Version: A formalization of version numbers as mathematical objects.

> Resolve: The resolution engine. This takes a request for several objects, and returns a list containing all the objects and their dependencies, avoiding version clashes or other conflicts.
